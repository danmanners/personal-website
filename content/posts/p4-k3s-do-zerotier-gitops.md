In part 4 of getting things up and going, we'll be covering setting up your K3s GitHub infrastructure repository and getting everything up and going with FluxCD. Additionally, I'll be going through some of the automation with GitHub actions for building multi-arch docker containers, and how I have this whole website set up.

## Software Requirements

- You have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed on your system.
- You have [fluxctl](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/1.21.0/references/fluxctl/) installed on your system

## Assumptions

- You have a GitHub account, and you've already set up your SSH keys and everything else.
- You have a Docker Hub account, or can set one up.

## Creating up your K3s GitHub Infrastructure Repo

First off, we'll need to create a new blank repository.

## What's coming up

In our final section, I'll be covering:

- All of the automation of everything in the past 4 sections
- Diagramming this whole shebang out
- General thoughts and how this could be improved
